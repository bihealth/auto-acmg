Frameshift/Nonsense:
- undergo NMD -> biological relevant:

- not undergo NMD -> critical for protein function:

- not undergo NMD -> not critical for protein function -> frequent in general population:

- not undergo NMD -> not critical for protein function -> rare in general population -> removes >10% of protein:
