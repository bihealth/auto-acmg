This variant was originally reported in two compound heterozygous (c.131_132delAG; p.

This variant has been detected in at least 9 patients reported in the literature with ethylmalonic encephalopathy, however, many of the cases are not scoreable according to the SVI recommendation for in trans criterion for PM3, as parental phasing was not performed or the second variant was a VUS (PMID: 18593870; PMID: 16183799, PMID: 30298498). After review of scoreable cases, it was determined by the ETHE1 VCEP that four reported cases were scorable.

Additionally, while the p.E44fsX105 has not been formally curated at this time, given that the p.E44fsX105 is a truncating variant that is predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay, it is also a strong candidate for a pathogenic classification; the VCEP agreed that this was justification to score this case as 1.0. Patients reported in PMID: 22020834 and PMID: 27771676 were each awarded 0.25 for their respective VUS’s, which were also confirmed in trans.

This was confirmed by Baylor Genetics who performed the testing for this study (PM3_Strong; Total score- 2.0). ETHE1 encodes persulfide dioxygenase.  Persulfide dioxygenase activity measured in recombinant human ETHE1 proteins (both wild-type and p.R163Q) expressed in E.Coli (purified to homogeneity) showed that the p.R163Q recombinant E.Coli only exhibited ~10% of wild-type catalytic activity, indicating that this variant impacts protein function (PS3_supporting; PMID: 25198162). One other missense variant [c.487C>T, p.R163W; PMID 14732903, PMID 16828325, PMID 16183799, PMID 28698729; ClinVar Variation ID: 2317], in the same codon has been classified as pathogenic for ethylmalonic encephalopathy by the ClinGen ETHE1 VCEP (PM5). The computational predictor [REVEL] gives a score of 0.928, which is above the threshold of 0.75, evidence that correlates with impact on ETHE1 function (PP3). In summary, this variant meets the criteria to be classified as pathogenic for Autosomal Recessive Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen ETHE1 VCEP (version 1.0): PM3_strong, PP4_Moderate, PS3_supporting, PM5, PP3. Approved 7/12/2021."

While one cell line is greater than the MDEP BS3 cutoff of 75%, one is between the ClinGen MDEP cutoffs for PS3 (<=40%) and BS3, and therefore neither PS3 nor BS3 is applied. This variant was identified in one family and segregated with diabetes with two informative meioses; however, this does not meet the thresholds for PP1 or PS4 set by the ClinGen MDEP (PMIDs: 27236918, 15883474).  An individual in this family had a clinical history highly specific for HNF1A-monogenic diabetes (MODY probability calculator result >50%, negative genetic testing for HNF4A, and antibody negative) (PP4_Moderate; PMID 15883474).  Another missense variant, c.1136C>G (p.Pro379Arg), has been classified as pathogenic by the ClinGen MDEP but has a greater Grantham distance than p.Pro379His (PM5_Supporting).  In summary, c.1136C>A meets the criteria to be classified as benign for monogenic diabetes. ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen MDEP (specification version 2.1.0, approved 8/11/2023): BA1, PM5_Supporting, PP4_Moderate, PP3."

As this variant meets 2 strong and 1 supporting benign criteria it can be classified as benign even though in silico predictions meet PP3.
