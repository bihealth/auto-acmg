This variant was originally reported in two compound heterozygous (c.131_132delAG; p.

This variant has been detected in at least 9 patients reported in the literature with ethylmalonic encephalopathy, however, many of the cases are not scoreable according to the SVI recommendation for in trans criterion for PM3, as parental phasing was not performed or the second variant was a VUS (PMID: 18593870; PMID: 16183799, PMID: 30298498). After review of scoreable cases, it was determined by the ETHE1 VCEP that four reported cases were scorable. A single relative from family L from PMID: 14732903 was awarded 1.0 as this patient was a compound heterozygote for an upstream truncating variant (c.131_132delAG; p.

Additionally, while the p.E44fsX105 has not been formally curated at this time, given that the p.E44fsX105 is a truncating variant that is predicted to undergo nonsense mediated decay, it is also a strong candidate for a pathogenic classification; the VCEP agreed that this was justification to score this case as 1.0. Patients reported in PMID: 22020834 and PMID: 27771676 were each awarded 0.25 for their respective VUS’s, which were also confirmed in trans.

Persulfide dioxygenase activity measured in recombinant human ETHE1 proteins (both wild-type and p.R163Q) expressed in E.Coli (purified to homogeneity) showed that the p.R163Q recombinant E.Coli only exhibited ~10% of wild-type catalytic activity, indicating that this variant impacts protein function (PS3_supporting; PMID: 25198162).

This variant resides within the kinase domain of MTOR that is defined as a critical functional domain by the ClinGen BMEP (PMIDs: 23322780, 27482884, 21210909) (PM1_Supporting).  This variant has been shown to significantly increase phosphorylation levels in experiments with case and controls cells of similar isogenic backgrounds indicating that this variant impacts protein function (PMID: 24631838) (PS3_Supporting).  The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence in controls (PS4_M; PMIDs: 25799227, 29281825, identified in 2 individuals with neuropathology confirmatory of a malformation of cortical development, 1 individual with neuroimaging appearance consistent with a malformation of cortical development (without neuropathology), 5 tumor samples in the literature and COSMIC).  Testing of unaffected and affected tissue show variable allelic fractions consistent with a post-zygotic event (PS2_Moderate; PMID: 25799227).  In summary, this variant meets the criteria to be classified as Pathogenic for mosaic autosomal dominant overgrowth with or without cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR-pathway genes based on the ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Expert Panel: PM2_P, PP2, PM5, PM1_P, PS3_P, PS4_M, PS2_M; 10 points (VCEP specifications version 1; Approved: 1/31/2021)"
